## Features

This library mostly provides more or less handy extensions to the platform classes such as UIView, UIImage, CGRect, String, Array, NSDateFormatter, CGPoint, UIColor etc. Browse the source inside the Pod package for full inventory. 

Most notable features are:


* **ReadWriteLock**
A synchronization lock for interthread resource access. The implementation is based on **pthread_rwlock_t**.
The recommended way to use the lock is via the higher level methods:
```swift
let value: Int = lock.withReadLock {
	return myDataStructure.findValue(key)
}
// .. 
lock.withWriteLock {
	myDataStructure.insertValue(newValue, key: key)
}
```
Or you can use the lower level API for finer-grained control:
```swift
func foo() {}
	defer {
		lock.unlock()
	}
	lock.lockToWrite()
	// Write safely to a shared resource
}
func bar() {
	defer {
	    lock.unlock()
    }
    lock.lockToRead()
    // Read safely from a shared resource
}
```

* **Threading utils**
The library provides global functions for asynchronously executing a block of code on main or an background thread.
```swift
runInBackground {
	// Execute a long running task on an unspecified background thread
    runOnMainThread {
    	// After the task completes, notify the UI thread about the completion
    }
}
```

* **UIImage utils**
The library provides certain commonly used image manipulation utilities.
```swift
let blurredImage = image.blur(5.0) // Returns a blurred image
let croppedImage = image.cropImageToSquare() // Returns a cropped square image from the middle of the original
let normalizedImage = image.imageWithNormalizedOrientation() // Returns an image with any orientation information removed
let scaledImage = image.scaleDown(maxSize: CGSize(width: 800, height: 800)) // Returns an image with max size 800x800, scaled down if required, with original aspect ratio
```

## Contributing 

Contributions to this library are welcomed. Any contributions have to meet the following criteria:

* Meaningfulness. Discuss whether what you are about to contribute indeed belongs to this library in the first place before submitting a pull request.
* Code style. Follow our [Swift style guide](https://github.com/qvik/swift) 100%.
* Stability. No code in the library must ever crash; never place *assert()*s or implicit optional unwrapping in library methods.
* Testing. Every util method, function and extension in the library must have unit tests, preferably triggering both successful and unsuccessful calls. All custom views/controls should have proper documentation and usage examples.
* Logging. No production code in the library must write logs. Unit tests may output logs.

### Submit your code

All merges to the **master** branch go through a *Merge ('pull') Request* and MUST meet the above criteria.

In other words, follow the following procedure to submit your code into the library:

* Clone the library repository
* Create a feature branch for your code
* Code it, clean it up, test it thoroughly
* Make sure all your methods meant to be public are defined as public
* Push your branch
* Create a merge request

## Updating the pod

As a contributor you do not need to do this; we'll update the pod whenever needed by projects.

* Update QvikSwift.podspec and set s.version to match the upcoming tag
* Commit all your changes, merge all pending accepted *Merge ('pull') Requests*
* Create a new tag following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/); eg. `git tag -a 2.2.0 -m "Your tag comment"`
* `git push --tags`
* `pod repo push qvik-podspecs QvikSwift.podspec`

Unless already set up, you might do the following steps to set up the pod repo:

* ```pod repo add qvik-podspecs https://github.com/qvik/qvik-podspecs.git```
