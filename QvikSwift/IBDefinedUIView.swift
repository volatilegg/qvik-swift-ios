 A UIView subclass that when further subclassed, allows defining the custom
 view's contents with Interface Builder, using @IBOutlets, and having those
 definitions automatically loaded.
 
 To use this, create a class that subclasses this one, and a xib file with
 the same name containing a single top level UIView object and the
 corresponding class set as the File's Owner (NOT as the custom class for
 the UIView).
